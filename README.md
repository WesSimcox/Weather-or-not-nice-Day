## Description
The Weather Dashboard is a website that allows a user to enter the name of any city and find the weather in that location. This website gives the user a 5-day forecast of the weather there as well. This is done using an API called Openweathermap. This allows the script of this website to make calls to the API, and then provide the relavent information to diplay onto the dashboard for the user.
